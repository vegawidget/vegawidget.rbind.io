As I was building the [slides](vegawidget.pdf) for this presentation, I noticed that it started out as vegawidget the *package*, and ended up as vegawidget the *organization*. 

## Packages

We are pleased to announce the CRAN release of [vegawidget 0.2.1](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget), which uses Vega-Lite 3.3.0. 

We see the vegawidget package as playing a role within a larger vegawidget organization. Here's how we see the end-to-end process of building and deploying a Vega-Lite chart using R:

Working backwards from the end-user, we see three steps: the Vega-Lite library itself, rendering a JSON specification into a chart, and composing a specification:

- [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)

  - provides an interactive grammar-of-graphics
  - JavaScript library that runs in the browser

- Rendering

  - [vegawidget](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget/): htmlwidget package to deliver Vega-Lite specifications to Vega-Lite; also provide interactive access to Vega-Lite charts. ![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-blue.svg)
			
- Composing

These packages are created by members of the [vegawidget organization](https://github.com/vegawidget):

  - [altair](https://vegawidget.github.io/altair): wraps Python package [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io), covers entire Vega-Lite API. ![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-blue.svg)
    
  - [vlbuildr](https://vegawidget.github.io/vlbuildr): covers entire Vega-Lite API, with pipeable functions.	![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)
  
  - [ggvega](https://vegawidget.github.io/ggvega): translator from [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) to Vega-Lite. ![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)
    
Going forward, we expect to focus more-and-more on the packages to *compose* specifications, while the vegawidget package *renders* in the "background".
