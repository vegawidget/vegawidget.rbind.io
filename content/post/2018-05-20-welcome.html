<p>The effort to bring Vega-Lite to the R community is collaborative; so it appropriate that the <strong>altair</strong> package be hosted by an organization. The altair R package uses the <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html">Altair Python package</a> to create <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a> specifications for interactive charts.</p>
<p>This group is named <strong>vegawidget</strong>, after the <code>altair::vegawidget()</code> function, which is used to render Vega and Vega-Lite chart specifications into HTML. In the not-so-distant future, this renderer will have its own package, also hosted by this organization.</p>
