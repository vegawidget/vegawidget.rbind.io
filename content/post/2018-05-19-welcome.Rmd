The effort to bring Vega-Lite to the R community is collaborative; so it appropriate that the **altair** package be hosted by an organization. The altair R package uses the [Altair Python package](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) to create [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) specifications for interactive charts.

This group is named **vegawidget**, after the `altair::vegawidget()` function, which is used to render Vega and Vega-Lite chart specifications into HTML. In the not-so-distant future, this renderer will have its own package, also hosted by this organization.
